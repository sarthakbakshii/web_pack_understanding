step 1) Basic initinalising.

`npm init -y` create a package.json

`npm i webpack webpack-cli --save-dev`

step 2)create a file: `webpack.config.js`

with basic:

```
module.exports = {}
```

step 3) add entry : ` entry: "./app/index.js",`

step 4) install svg-inline-loader.

`npm install svg-inline-loader --save-dev`
visit npmjs.com for doc and config
add confugiration as loader.

```
module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.svg$/,
                loader: 'svg-inline-loader'
            }
        ],
    },
```

check for understanding.js for context of loader.

install css-loader.

`npm install --save-dev css-loader style-loader`

```
{
    test: /\.css$/i,
    use: ["style-loader", "css-loader"],
}
```

install bable-loader.

add config:

```
{
    test: /\.(js)$/, // this is regex, and () means group of js file, without it, its just fine a js file
    use: 'bable-loader',
}
```

step 4) add output dir

```
output: {
    path: "",
    filename: "",
}
```

import path,

`const path = require("path")`

no need to istall it, it comes with node.

so as per the more common practice:

```
output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
    filename: "bundle.js",
  }
```

step 5)Definition time, move to `understanding.md`

Now Its time to use HTML injection plugin,
Steps and understang will be here : `understanding.md`

step 6) webpack dev server.

Definition time, move to `understanding.md`

install: `npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev`

step 7) As we know we wrote Entry in webpack.config.

so create a file: `app/index.js` now, and write a simple code:

```
const myArray = ["Jaipur", "Delhi", "Paris"];

console.log(myArray)
```

Tea break 1) what happens till now, lets have a recap:

so when i run `npm build`

this will run the webpack,
It will go in webpack configuration.
It will check for the enrty point.
So what every code we are writing, some how goes into index.js
If we use any svg or css or moder js file it will handle that, in modules loaders.
And will throw all the final bundle file into output `buldle.js`
As we are using a html injection plugin it will inject it into html file

step 8) npm run build.

now it will create a folder automaticly, dist, and add compiled files in it.

or use `npm run start` to keep it running always.
