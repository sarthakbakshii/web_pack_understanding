# Lets start with steps to make a project from scratch!
**Step 1) Basic initinalising.**

- `npm init -y` create a package.json

- `npm i webpack webpack-cli --save-dev`

**Step 2) Create a file: `webpack.config.js`**

- with basic code :

```
module.exports = {}
```

**Step 3) Add entry in config :**

- ` entry: "./app/index.js",`

**Step 4) Installation of basic loaders : SVG, CSS, Modern JS**
> **Note:** Check for `<readme.mdx> outside the folder` for context of loader..

- Install:  `svg-inline-loader`

`npm install svg-inline-loader --save-dev`

> **Note:** visit npmjs.com for doc and config.

- Add confugiration as loader.

```
module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.svg$/,
                loader: 'svg-inline-loader'
            }
        ],
    },
```




- Install:  `css-loader`
> **Note:** visit npmjs.com for doc and config.

`npm install --save-dev css-loader style-loader`

- Add confugiration as loader.

```
{
    test: /\.css$/i,
    use: ["style-loader", "css-loader"],
}
```

- Install: `bable-loader`

- Add confugiration as loader.

```
{
    test: /\.(js)$/, // this is regex, and () means group of js file, without it, its just fine a js file
    use: 'bable-loader',
}
```

**Step 4) Add output dir**

- Basic code
```
output: {
    path: "",
    filename: "",
}
```

- Import path: `const path = require("path")`

> Note: no need to install it, it comes with node.

so as per the more common practice:

```
output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
    filename: "bundle.js",
  }
```

**Step 5) Definition time, move to `<readme.mdx> outside the folder`**

- Now Its time to use HTML injection plugin,
Steps and understang will be here : `<readme.mdx> outside the folder`

**Step 6) webpack dev server**

> Definition time, move to `<readme.mdx> outside the folder`

- Install: `npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev`

**Step 7) As we know we wrote Entry in webpack.config.**

so create a file: `app/index.js` now, and write a simple code:

```
const myArray = ["Jaipur", "Delhi", "Paris"];

console.log(myArray)
```

***Tea break 1) what happens till now, lets have a recap:***

> - so when i run `npm build`
> - this will run the webpack,
> - It will go in webpack configuration.
> - It will check for the enrty point.
> - So what every code we are writing, some how goes into index.js
> - If we use any svg or css or moder js file it will handle that, in modules loaders.
>-  And will throw all the final bundle file into output `buldle.js`
>-  As we are using a html injection plugin it will inject it into html file

**Step 8) Running run build.**

`npm run build` now it will create a folder automaticly, dist, and add compiled files in it.

or use `npm run start` to keep it running always.
